### 1. Introduction/Background
Object detection and digit recognition has become the most fundamental but hottest topics in machine learning because of its creative potential in real world scenarios. It is thus necessary to create automated systems that can help read and categorize text and digit when necessary in order to get rid of simple but repetitive work needed to be done by human beings.

Although digit recognition itself is a basic task in computer vision, it is still an important step towards solving more complicated problems. There has been a variety of related works that use different machine learning methods such as simple PyTorch and neural networks to train the data but tend to be specialized to particular applications or even datasets. Thus, there is still the necessity to always optimize existing models for better results no matter how much research has been done to create a more packable and effective tool that can fulfill the needs of higher-level research. Innovation is endless as more work can always be done to improve the efficiency and accuracy of current models and employ the solution in real world situations.
